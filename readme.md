# Social Icons

This is a dead simple collection of up-to-date social icons. There's only a few in here at the moment. Feel free to make an [issue](https://github.com/mattmischuk/social-icons/issues) on [GitHub](https://github.com/mattmischuk/social-icons/) to request social icons.

### Why does this exist?

I felt like on every project I was trying to source good SVGs of the most common social networks. This was created to manage that collection. This initial build was just done quickly. In future versions I'll add a invisible bounding box to all SVGs so they will be spaced out correctly.
